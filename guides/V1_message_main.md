# Message

A message is an entry in a conversation.

A person can create a message to place into a conversation via an app such as IBM Workspace. An app too can place a message into a conversation acting under its own identity. And of course other people and apps, who are participating in the conversation can see these messages.

Watson Work Services represents a Message with this object.

| property      | type          | description  |
| ------------- |:------------- |:-----|
| id          | ID      | The ID of the message. The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as "4") or integer (such as 4) input value will be accepted as an ID.|
| created     | Date        | Date this message  was created |
| createdBy   | Person    | Person who created this message |
| updated     | Date    | Date this message  was updated |
| updatedBy   | Person | Person who updated this message  |
| softDeleted | Boolean | Indicates whether this message is soft-deleted. Soft-deleted messages will return null content and empty annotations. This requires the `EXPERIMENTAL` value in `x-graphql-view header`. |
| content   | String | The body of the message |
| contentType | String | Mime type of the message content  |
| annotations | [String] | A set of optional objects/attachments that are added to a message, called annotations. Each annotation represents meta data that are related to the message. An annotation is represented by a structured format, which can be viewed as a template. There are different annotation types, some are used to store results of cognitive analysis to a message for example. An annotation can be added at message create time or later, as an update.  Apps are currently limited to create only one type of annotation called `generic` |
| reactions | [Reaction] | A set of optional objects that are added to a message, called reactions. Each reaction represents how users reacted to the message. A Reaction is represented by the reaction (String, usually an emoji but not required), the count (Int, number of users that reacted with the same reaction), and viewerHasReacted (Boolean, true, the calling user reacted with given reaction, or false, the calling user did not). This requires the `EXPERIMENTAL` value in `x-graphql-view header`. _Since this is an_ `EXPERIMENTAL` _capability, complete information can be found in our github repo, [see Coming Next section](../docs/get-started/coming-next) for more info_. |
