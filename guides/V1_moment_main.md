# Moment

Watson Work Services analyzes messages in each space to identify **moments**.

Each moment includes a summary of a group of messages. The summary includes summary phrases, participants, and other information extracted from messages.

Observers can catch up and understand the significance of activity that has transpired since their last visit, or use moments to get a glimpse into an ongoing discussion without reading all the messages.

Moments are automatically created as a conversation progresses.

The [Conversation](./guides/V1_conversation_main.md) object also references the collection of moments for that conversation, so in addition to dedicated queries for moments by their ID or by a space ID, you can query for moments in many places where you query for messages in conversations.

| property      | type          | description  |
| ------------- |:------------- |:-----|
| id | ID | The unique ID for this moment. The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. |
| live | Boolean | True indicates this moment is ongoing and may receive updates |
| startTime | Date | Date and time this moment started |
| endTime | Date | Date and time this moment ended |
| keyMessage | Message | A messages which is most representative of the discussion in the moment |
