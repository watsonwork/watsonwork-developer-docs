## Meetings Overview

Watson Work Services provides a set of **meeting** APIs for callers to start and get details about meetings.  Meetings are online collaboration sessions which allow users to communicate with one another using the Workspace client, Zoom client, or a basic telephone.  Meetings include audio, video, screensharing, and whiteboarding.  Meetings happen within the context of a **space** and can either be restricted to only members of that space, or can be opened to public access so you can meet with people outside of your team or company.
