# Space

In Watson Work Services a space is the place where people come together to collaborate.
It represents the container for the people who are collaborating, and it contains the resources people
use to engage in collaboration - for example a space holds the conversation, which is where people exchange messages.

Watson Work Services represents a Space with this object.

| id          | ID      | The unique ID for this space. The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache.
