## Moment Annotation

Moment Annotations use the type **conversation-moment** to mark the beginning of a moment.

Here's a sample of an annotation created by the Moments service:  
```json

{
  "type":"conversation-moment",
  "momentVersion":6,
  "algorithm":"timegap",
  "annotationId":"5810ed1fe4b04572602fed37",

### Moment Annotation

The moment annotation is the structure added as an annotation to the first message in the moment. The definition of the moment annotation references several other structures detailed below.

See also [Annotation](../guides/V1_annotations.md) for information on common annotation fields.

| property      | type          | description  |
| ------------- |:------------- |:------------ |
| type          | String        | For a moment annotation, the type will be _conversation-moment_. |
| momentId      | ID            | An autogenerated unique ID for this moment. This may be used by clients to track changes to a moment over time as it is updated |
| momentVersion | Number        | The schema version for this moment |
| algorithm     | String        | An identifier of the algorithm used to create this moment |
| spaceId       | ID            | The ID of the space to which this moment belongs |
| participants  | \[MomentParticipant\] | An array of participants to the moment. |
| startMessage  | MomentMessageReference | The first message in the moment |
| endMessage    | MomentMessageReference | The last message in the moment |
| lastUpdatedMessage | MomentMessageReference | The last message processed as part of the moment summary - will be the same as the endMessage if the moment has ended |
| hidden        | Boolean       | Clients may decide to not show moments marked as hidden |
| momentSummary | MomentSummary | Summarizes the conversation and events in the moment |

### MomentParticipant

A **MomentParticipant** contains information about a user or app and their level of participation in the moment.

| property      | type          | description  |
| ------------- |:------------- |:------------ |
| authorId      | ID            | The ID of an author of part of the moment, if the author is a user of Watson Work Services |
| messageCount  | Number        | The number of messages sent by this author in this moment |
| source        | String        | An optional source of the user information |
| actorName     | String        | An optional user name provided by another source |
| actorUrl      | String        | An optional URL to the user from another source |
| actorAvatar   | String        | An optional URL of the avatar from another source |

### MomentSummary

The **MomentSummary** contains information extracted from and derived from the conversation occurring in the moment.

| property      | type          | description  |
| ------------- |:------------- |:------------ |
| mostRelevantMessage | MomentMessageReference | The _mostRelevantMessage_ field specifies a message which Watson Work Services has identified as particularly relevant to this moment |
| phrases       | \[MomentPhrase\] | An array of phrases identified to help summarize the moment, ordered by descending relevance |

### MomentPhrase

A **MomentPhrase** helps provide a label or summary for the moment.  It's typically a set of key phrases or topics.

| property      | type          | description  |
| ------------- |:------------- |:------------ |
| label         | String        | The content of the summary phrase |
| source        | String        | Currently, one of _keyword_ or _entity_ |
| count         | Number        | The number of occurrences of this phrase in the moment if available |
| category      | String        | More information about the phrase. For instance, the type of an entity |

### MomentMessageReference

A **MomentMessageReference** represents a reference in the moment annotation to a message.

| property      | type          | description  |
