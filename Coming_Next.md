## Coming Next

Here’s the stuff we’re working on next for you and IBM Watson Work Services.

| Coming Next   |
| :-------------|
| **Creating Solutions.** We're adding a guide that helps you to develop solutions, based on the work we're doing on **Templates**. For now, it's `EXPERIMENTAL` and you can find it here, [Creating Solutions](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/Creating_Solutions.md).  |
| **Templates.** We're adding **Templates** for you to create custom experiences for teams. It's `EXPERIMENTAL` but you can check it out here, [Space Template](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/V1_space_template_main.md). We have [Create a Space Template](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/V1_create_space_template.md), [Share a Space Template](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/V1_share_space_template.md), [Space Template Info](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/V1_space_template_info.md), [Get Space Template](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/V1_get_space_template.md), [Get My Space Templates](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/V1_get_my_space_templates.md) and [Delete a Space Template](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/V1_delete_space_template.md). For templates associated with specific offerings, we have [Get Offering Space Templates](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/V1_get_offering_space_templates.md). To create (and update) spaces from templates see [Create a Space from a Template](https://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs/blob/master/guides/V1_create_space_from_template.md) |
