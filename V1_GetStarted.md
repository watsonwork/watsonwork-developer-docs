## Welcome to Watson Work Services

 You’ve come to the right place if you want to build apps that take advantage of conversational and cognitive services, powered by Watson. With Watson Work Services, not only can you build capabilities to customize your team’s use of Watson Workspace, and create apps that will integrate with Watson Workspace, you can also develop apps for other business tools.

These services are built for extensibility. They are meant to extend your experience with Watson Workspace and your everyday tools - making it easier for you and others to get work done.

In Watson Workspace, users collaborate in a space, a virtual workspace. They can converse, share files, work with other tools and more. There are cognitive capabilities such as moments and action fulfillment built in. As an app developer, there is a lot you can do to enhance that experience.

Let’s get started building apps with Watson Work Services!
